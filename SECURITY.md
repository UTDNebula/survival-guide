# Project Nebula Security Policy

This security policy documents how to record a security vulnerability in Nebula
web app and how the Project Nebula maintainers respond to such inquiries.

## Supported Versions

**The current pre-release version of the UTD Survival Guide will have security
bugs fixed on an ad-hoc basis until the first public release.**

| Version     | Supported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a service vulnerability detectable in the user-facing portions
of this app, contact the Nebula maintainers at development@acmutd.co
with the subject line `[nebula]: User-Facing Security Vulnerability`.

If the issue is due to something internal - like a vulnerability in the app's
library dependencies, open an [issue](https://github.com/acmutd/nebula/issues/new/choose)
and tag it with the `vulnerability` label.

One a maintainer triages the issue and determines it to be an actual vulnerability,
work will immediately begin to resolve it. The fix will be applied to the
`develop` branch as soon as possible and once merged into `master` will be
published to the web app, which will apply changes on page reload.

The maintainers will reply to the issue once it is resolved or once a week until
resolution, whichever is earlier.
