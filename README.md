# UTD Survival Guide
*UTD Survival Guide is a guide to being a college student and making the most of your time at UT Dallas.*

**A work in progress**

## About
College is difficult.

Maybe you passed your standardized tests, did a bunch of extracurriculars, and
chose a major.

But what happens next? Now you're at this new place for four years (more or
less), and it's nothing like you've experienced before. Even more frighening is
what happens if you're not like most students. What if you're a non-traditional
student who's coming from a community college? How about first-generation? What
about if you're a veteran?

Resources and information scattered throughout dozens of web pages, and even
more is only spread through word-of-mouth.

Why not document all of that information in one place?

Part of [Project Nebula](https://github.com/acmutd/nebula-web), the UTD Survival
Guide seeks to be _the_ place people go when they want honest, useful
information about UTD and its students. Even more than that, the Guide will
provide a glimpse of student life in an easy, accessible manner.

This repository, `nebula-guide` contains code for the Guide's website.
